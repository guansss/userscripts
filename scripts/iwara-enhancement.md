- Enlarges the content area on screens with 2K+ resolution.
- Displays like rates in content list and highlights the items with like rate higher than 4%.
- Uses newer version of the video player (5.6.0 -> 7.10.1), a significant change is that you can double click on the player to toggle fullscreen.
- Remembers volume settings permanently. I know some of you guys visit this site in incognito mode and therefore have to set the volume every time, so this is to save your hands.
- Automatically downloads the video in the highest resolution and with a formatted filename when clicking the download button.
- Converts image post titles to links in search page.
- Supports Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey.

Note the userscript settings will be lost when exiting the incognito mode,
so in order to save the settings permanently, you need to modify them in non-incognito mode.

With Tampermonkey, you can benefit from the download manager of your browser, that is, you don't have to wait for the download to finish before closing the page. To achieve that, you may do as follows:
1. Navigate to Tampermonkey's settings panel and then the Settings tab.
2. In General section, set Config Mode to `Advanced` (or `Beginner`).
3. In Downloads BETA section, set Download Mode to `Browser API`.
4. Grant the permission if requested.
