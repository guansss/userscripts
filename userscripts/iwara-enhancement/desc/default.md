With Tampermonkey, you can benefit from the download manager of your browser, that is, you don't have to wait for the
download to finish before closing the page. To achieve that, you may do as follows:

1. Navigate to Tampermonkey's settings panel and then the Settings tab.
2. In General section, set Config Mode to `Advanced` (or `Beginner`).
3. In Downloads BETA section, set Download Mode to `Browser API`.
4. Grant the permission if requested.
